=== @RunOnce

The `grails.testing.spock.RunOnce` annotation may be applied to any Spock test
fixture method that you wish to be executed only once.  This is useful when
applied in conjunction with a fixture annnotation like `@Before` as shown below.

[source,groovy]

Applying both the `@RunOnce` and `@Before` annotations to a method will yield
behavior similar to the behavior associated with Spock's `setupSpec` method but
an important difference is that `setupSpec` is run before the test instance is
subjected to dependency injection while `@Before` methods are run after the
test instance is subjected to dependency injection.  This means that the
`setupSpec` method will not have access to injected variables but methods marked
with `@Before` will have access to injected variables.  If a test has some one
time setup logic that needs to be executed after dependency injection happens,
the `RunOnce` annotation can help accomplish that.

=== @OnceBefore

The `grails.testing.spock.OnceBefore` annotation is a shorthand way of
accomplishing the same behavior that would be accomplished by applying both the
`@RunOnce` and `@Before` annotations to a fixture method.

This is useful in the context of an integration test which wants to reference
dependency injected values during setup as shown below.
