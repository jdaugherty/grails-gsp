This library was designed to be compatible with the old mixin approach. There are some slight differences that you may encounter, however any required changes should be minimal.

=== FreshRuntime Removed

The `@FreshRuntime` annotation was removed due to the design of the new framework. The annotation allowed any metaclass changes to be sandboxed either at the method or class level. Spock provides a similar annotation to do the same thing, link:http://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1/all_in_one.html#_confinemetaclasschanges[@ConfineMetaClassChanges].

In addition, the annotation caused the application context to be refreshed. Because the application context is refreshed between test classes automatically, the annotation is no longer necessary.

=== Integration Tests

The `@Integration` annotation was copied to this library so a dependency on the old framework is no longer necessary. The package has changed from `grails.test.mixin.integration.Integration` to `grails.testing.mixin.integration.Integration`. Everything about integration tests should work the same as before.

=== Example Converted Test

Here is an example test that may look like something in your project.

[source,groovy]
----
@TestFor(AuthorController)
@Mock(Author)
class AuthorControllerTests {

    @Test
    void testIndex() {
        controller.index()
        assert response.text == 'Hello'
    }
}
----

To convert this test to the new framework, we must update it to use Spock as well as change the annotation usages to trait usages.

[source,groovy]
----
import spock.lang.Specification
import grails.testing.gorm.DomainUnitTest
import grails.testing.web.controllers.ControllerUnitTest

class AuthorControllerTests extends Specification implements ControllerUnitTest<AuthorController>, DomainUnitTest<Author> {

    void testIndex() {
        when:
        controller.index()

        then:
        response.text == 'Hello'
    }
}
----

Obviously there are many use cases you may want to convert and it would be impossible to cover them all in this documentation. As a part of the testing of this new framework, all of the usages of the old framework were replaced in Grails core. You can view those changes by looking at link:https://github.com/grails/grails-core/commit/8c4f07743108bf1e4e5f69dbb57695cce0b2518d[this commit] to see the vast majority of examples you will need.
